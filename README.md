## Emotion-Detection---Computer-Vision-CNN-
Detects and classify emotions of humans based on pictures. Model accuracy 63%. 

It could be used in HR analytics for improving employee satisfaction and productivity. We generally make employee feedback very boring by floating forms. 
But what if we do a live survey which would be voice recognized one. For example, the question will pop up, and the employee will answer in option. 
The voice and video of the employee will be recorded. The employee will be asked to switch on the camera for the security check that it is him. 
While the general feedback is on, the software will keep on capturing the image of the employee's face. After the feedback is over, this algorithm of 
emotion detection will be run on it to classify and detect emotion. Based on that employees will be grouped with the help of K means clustering in 
Machine learning. Finally, those groups will be sent for a one to one counseling by HR. This will give the organization a keen idea about an 
employee's emotional status.
